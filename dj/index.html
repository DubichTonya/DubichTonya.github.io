              tour".[51] The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the Night Visions album cycle.
              Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the Night Visions cycle, saying that "We're always writing
              on the road, [so] that second album will come, unless we die.
              next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it
              may come"

              When the last-minute request is for a focus group, it’s usually a sign that the
              request originated in Marketing. When Web sites are being designed, the folks in
              Marketing often feel like they don’t have much clout. Even though they’re the
              ones who spend the most time trying to figure out who the site’s audience is and
              what they want, the designers and developers are the ones with most of the
              hands-on control over how the site actually gets put together.
